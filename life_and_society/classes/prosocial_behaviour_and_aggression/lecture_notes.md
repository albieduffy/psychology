# Life and Society: Prosocial Behaviour and Aggression

## Prosocial Behaviour

### What is Prosocial Behaviour?

Prosocial behaviour refers to **voluntary actions intended to benefit another person or group of people**. Examples include:
- Sharing  
- Helping  
- Comforting  
- Charitable giving  

These behaviours are central to understanding what binds humans together and why we act altruistically, even toward strangers.

> **Definition:** Prosocial behaviour = Voluntary behaviour intended to benefit someone else.

---

### Human Ultrasociality

Humans are often described as **ultrasocial**, meaning we live in large, cooperative societies and depend on others for survival and success. The question of *why* humans are prosocial—especially when it sometimes comes at personal cost—is a central theme in social psychology and evolutionary theory.

---

### Are Children Naturally Prosocial?

Research by **Felix Warneken** and colleagues explores whether prosocial tendencies are innate.

#### Warneken’s Experiments:
- When Warneken **dropped a peg**, children spontaneously helped him pick it up.
- When he **threw** the peg (control condition), they did not help—suggesting they understood intent.
- When **putting magazines away**, children helped if he appeared to be struggling (e.g., bumping into a door), but not if it seemed intentional (placing them on top).
- Children continued to help even **at a personal cost**, such as when engaged in a fun activity.
- They also helped **without being thanked**, indicating their motivation was not driven by social reward.

> These findings suggest that **prosocial motivation emerges early in life**, and may not require external reinforcement.

### Tinbergen’s Four Questions

Ethologist **Niko Tinbergen** proposed that to understand behaviour fully, we must answer four types of questions:

| Type | Focus | Example Question |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Proximate (Mechanism)** | How does it work right now? | What drives the behaviour in an individual moment? |
| **Ontogenetic (Development)** | How does it develop over a lifetime? | How do children learn to help? |
| **Ultimate (Function)** | Why does it exist in evolutionary terms? | What benefit does prosocial behaviour have for survival? |
| **Phylogenetic (Evolutionary history)** | How did it evolve across species? | How is helping seen in primates? |

### Evolutionary Explanations for Prosocial Behaviour

Darwin’s **Theory of Evolution** suggests natural selection favours genes that promote survival and reproduction.  
At first glance, **helping others at personal cost** appears inconsistent with this principle—but several mechanisms explain why prosocial traits might evolve.

#### 1. **Kin Selection**
Humans tend to help those who share their genes, thus indirectly ensuring the survival of their genetic material.  
> Helping relatives increases the likelihood that shared genes are passed on.

**Reference:** Hamilton, W. D. (1964). *The genetical evolution of social behaviour.* Journal of Theoretical Biology, 7(1), 1–52.

#### 2. **Reciprocal Altruism**
Helping others can increase one’s own survival prospects over time if help is later reciprocated.

**Reference:** Trivers, R. L. (1971). *The evolution of reciprocal altruism.* Quarterly Review of Biology, 46(1), 35–57.

#### 3. **Prosocial Emotions and Parental Care**
- Human offspring have an unusually **long dependency period**.
- We evolved **emotions and cognitions** that make caregiving rewarding—such as empathy, love, and satisfaction from helping others.
- These emotional rewards motivate caring behaviour even outside kin relationships.

> “Empathic behaviour is more common in species with a prolonged period of pre-adult development.” (Preston, 2013)

#### 4. **Mate Selection**
Humans often prefer **prosocial partners**, associating kindness and empathy with reliability, cooperation, and good parenting potential.

### Social and Cultural Influences

Prosocial norms are reinforced through:
- **Social learning** (modeling behaviour of others)
- **Cultural expectations** (e.g., moral and religious teachings)
- **Reputation management** (desire to be seen as kind or cooperative)

---

## Aggression

### What is Aggression?

Aggression refers to **behaviour intended to harm another individual** who is motivated to avoid that harm (Baron & Richardson, 1994).  
It can take **physical**, **verbal**, or **relational** forms, and may be **hostile** (driven by anger) or **instrumental** (goal-oriented).

---

### Biological and Evolutionary Explanations

1. **Genetic Factors** – Twin and adoption studies suggest heritability of aggressive tendencies.  
2. **Hormonal Influences** – Testosterone levels are correlated with dominance and aggression.  
3. **Neurobiological Factors** – The amygdala and prefrontal cortex regulate aggression and impulse control.  

> Aggression may have evolved as an adaptive response to competition for resources, mates, or status.

**Reference:** Archer, J. (2009). *The nature of human aggression.* International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, 32(4), 202–208.

---

### Social Learning Theory (Bandura)

Albert Bandura proposed that aggression, like prosocial behaviour, is **learned through observation and imitation**.

#### Bobo Doll Experiment
Children who observed adults behaving aggressively toward a Bobo doll were more likely to imitate that behaviour.

> Suggests that **exposure to aggressive models increases the likelihood of aggressive acts**.

**Reference:** Bandura, A., Ross, D., & Ross, S. A. (1961). *Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models.* Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 63(3), 575–582.

---

### Frustration–Aggression Hypothesis

Proposed by Dollard et al. (1939), this theory states that **frustration (blocking of goal-directed behaviour)** leads to aggression.  
Later revisions highlight that frustration produces anger, which creates readiness for aggression if cues are present.

**Reference:** Berkowitz, L. (1989). *Frustration–aggression hypothesis: Examination and reformulation.* Psychological Bulletin, 106(1), 59–73.

---

### Situational Influences on Aggression

- **Heat hypothesis** – Aggression increases in hot temperatures.  
- **Crowding and noise** – Heightened arousal can lead to irritability and aggressive acts.  
- **Alcohol** – Reduces inhibition, increasing the likelihood of aggression.

---

### Reducing Aggression

Evidence-based interventions include:
- **Modelling non-aggressive behaviour**
- **Conflict resolution training**
- **Empathy development programs**
- **Media literacy education**
